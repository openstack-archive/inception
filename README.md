Inception: Towards a Nested Cloud Architecture
=========

Inception clouds are built entirely on top of the virtual resources
acquired from todayâ€™s clouds, and provide nested VMs to end users.

Inception clouds enable:

- Acceleration of continuous integration for open-source cloud
  management software such as OpenStack

- Hypervisor flexibility: VM live migration, VM replication for high
  availability, instant VM spawning under high load demand, intrusion
  detection by customizing Dom0 firewall...

- App-specific resource allocation: customize subscription ratio, VM
  consolidation

- Low operation overhead: no physical metals, therefore no worry on
  issues like cooling, power, cabling, rack design, malfunctioned
  hardware replacement, data center real estate

- Spanning across multiple providers: both private and public clouds
  over geographically wide area

Essentially, Inception clouds enable entire control of your cloud,
with even less operation overhead.
